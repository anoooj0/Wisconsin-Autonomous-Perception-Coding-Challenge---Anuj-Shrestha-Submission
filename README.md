Methodology:
  -Looked for datasets with images of cones
  -Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing
  -Found out which kind of algorithm was best suited for the task
  -Learned how to use the libraries associated with the algorithm
  -Looked up how to annotate boundary lines 
  -Wrote code for the model that would take images with cones and draw boundary lines for them
  -Ran code and refined it for more accurate results

  Struggles:
  -Had a lot of trouble finding a dataset
  -Struggled with drawing lines to fit the path of the cones
  -Had to use chatGPT alot and google to help me with the code
  

Libraries Used:
    -NumPy
    -OpenCV
    -MatPlotLib
    -OS
    -Zipfile
    -SKLearn
